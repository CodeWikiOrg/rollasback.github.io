# RollAsBack API Release

## Hello, World!

Welcome to the RollAsBack API Release! This release brings several exciting features and improvements to enhance your
experience with the RollAsBack API.
While we are still in the early stages of development, we are thrilled to share our progress with you and gather your
feedback to shape the future of the RollAsBack API.

We started the RollAsBack project with a vision to create a simple yet powerful API framework for building web
applications in Python. Our goal was to provide developers with a flexible and intuitive platform to create robust and
scalable web services.
Currently we are living in different countries and working remotely. We are trying to make the best of it and we are
doing our best to make the project better. We are always open to new ideas and contributions. We are looking forward to
your feedback and contributions to the project. Can Rollas (Computer Engineer) and Arda Tanıl Kersü (Electronics
Engineer) are the founders of the project.



Our team has been working hard to bring this vision to life, and we are excited to present the following features and
improvements in this release:

1. **Schedule Decorator**

    - **Overview:**
      The Schedule Decorator is designed to provide a convenient way to schedule and execute functions at specified intervals or times.

  

2. **Shared Message Pipe Communication Tool**

    - **Overview:**
      The Shared Message Pipe Communication Tool aims to facilitate communication between microservices through a shared message pipe.

 
3. **Class-Based Applications**

    - **Overview:**
      Class-Based Applications involve structuring applications around classes to enhance modularity, readability, and maintainability.
 
    

4. **WSGI-Based Solution**

    - **Overview:**
      A WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)-Based Solution involves building web applications using WSGI for improved compatibility and interoperability.


#### Funny Story 

- RollAsBack name comes from the combination of the surname of the founder Can Rollas and the word "Rollback". The name
  was chosen because the project was started with the idea of creating a simple and powerful API framework for building
  web applications in Python. The name "RollAsBack" was chosen to reflect the idea of rolling back to a simpler and more
  powerful way of building web applications. And the icon of the project is toilet paper. The toilet paper icon was chosen
  because it is a simple and powerful tool that everyone uses in their daily lives.  


Happy coding!

Can Rollas and Arda Tanıl Kersü
